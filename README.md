Uni project to learn how to use a EFM32 Giant Gecko Starter Kit.

The IDE we are using to work on the project is the Simplicity IDE.

(this is a student lab project from the subject "Prototipatge de Sistemes Encastats" (Computer Engineering, UAB), where we are not using any guide, not to be used as a guided class activity, since we are very new with this, but up to you ofc :))
